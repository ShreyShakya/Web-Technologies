      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Shrey and I am a current computer science student at Herald College Kathmandu. I have a passion for technology and programming, and I am constantly learning new skills and improving upon my existing ones. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and exploring new programming languages and technologies. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I have also worked with databases and web development. I am a quick learner and a problem-solver, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge and expertise. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer and to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world. Whether it's developing innovative new technologies or helping to solve complex problems, I am committed to using my knowledge and abilities to make a difference.
